# Product Overview

## Bed Reservation System

A real-time mobile web application that enables case workers to reserve beds for clients across multiple provider sites. The system provides two distinct interfaces:

- **Mobile Client App**: Used by case workers to view real-time bed availability and complete reservations on mobile devices
- **Site Admin UI**: Used by site administrators to manage bed inventory and reservations for their provider sites

## Key Features

- Real-time bed availability across all provider sites (updates within 2 seconds)
- Temporary 30-second holds to prevent double-booking during reservation process
- Role-based access control (case workers and site admins)
- Mobile-optimized touch interface for field workers
- Four bed types: apple, orange, lemon, grape (POC categories)

## User Workflows

**Case Worker**: View availability → Select bed type and site → Hold placed automatically → Enter client information → Confirm reservation

**Site Admin**: Manage bed inventory counts → View active reservations → Release beds when clients depart → Update site contact information
